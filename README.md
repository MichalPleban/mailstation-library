# Mailstation support libary

This library is intended to server as a stand-alone (i.e. not using any routines of the underlying operationg system) library of functions to develop applications for the [Cidco Mailstation](https://github.com/MichalPleban/mailstation-hardware) computer. The library works on all Z80-based Mailstation models, including DET1, DET2, DET1D and DET1E.

To compile the library, you need the `sdcc` Z80 C compiler. A simple test app is included, which allows to check the keyboard and screen handling routines.
